/**
 * Trust classification for cached terminal order statuses (COW-1183).
 * Ported 1:1 from the upstream ponder indexer's orderbook/trust.ts.
 *
 * The durable cache entities live outside the reorg journal's reach in
 * practice, so a terminal status cached right after a settlement can silently
 * outlive a reorg. Reorg detection can't close this: block handlers start at
 * "latest" and spend minutes to hours catching up after every deploy, during
 * which the orderbook API answers from the real tip while our cursor is
 * behind — reorgs up there resolve before we ever process those heights.
 *
 * Instead, a terminal row is only trusted permanently once it is provably
 * beyond the chain's reorg window W (per-chain, see reorgSafetyWindowSeconds):
 *
 *  - Fast path: validTo passed more than W ago. GPv2 rejects fills after
 *    validTo, so validTo is an upper bound on execution time — old orders
 *    (the whole owner-backfill flood) are final with zero re-fetching.
 *  - Cooling-off: otherwise the row is "soft" until a fetch made more than W
 *    after terminalSince re-confirmed the status. Wall clock is immune to
 *    indexer lag: the API can only report a fill after it happened in real
 *    time, so "still terminal W after first seen" proves the settlement
 *    survived W of real time.
 *
 * Soft rows are served but keep being re-fetched by the callers' existing
 * batched miss paths; a reorged-out status heals on the next poll.
